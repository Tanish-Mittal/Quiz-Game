# Quiz Game Repository

Welcome to the Quiz Game GitHub repository! This quiz game is built using the C programming language and employs linked lists for dynamic memory allocation, offering a real-life application of data structures in programming. Here's an overview of the project:

## Project Overview

- **Language:** C
- **Data Structure:** Linked List
- **Purpose:** To create an interactive quiz game that enhances understanding of linked lists and provides an engaging user experience.

## Features

1. **Main Menu:** The game features a main menu with four options:
   - **Start Game:** Begin the quiz by entering your username and selecting from 5 different quizzes, each with 10 questions.
   - **Help:** Access instructions and game rules.
   - **Previous Score:** View your previous quiz scores.
   - **Quit Game:** Exit the game.

2. **Interactive Quiz:** Users can choose a quiz, answer questions, and receive immediate feedback on the correctness of their answers. The game also provides the correct reason for each question.

3. **Quiz Results:** At the end of each quiz, the game displays the user's score and provides an option to replay or return to the main menu.

4. **User Records:** The linked list structure allows users to view their previous quiz scores and associated usernames. This feature demonstrates the practical use of linked lists in maintaining data records.

## Learning Experience

Building this quiz game has been a valuable learning experience. It has improved my understanding of C programming, data structures, and dynamic memory allocation. The project's interactive nature and real-time feedback showcase the practical application of these concepts.

## Getting Started

To run the quiz game, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC), and execute the program. Here are the commands to get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tanish-Mittal/QuizGame.git
cd QuizGame
gcc quiz_game.c -o quiz_game
./quiz_game
