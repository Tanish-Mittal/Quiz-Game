Welcome to the Quiz Game GitHub repository! This quiz game is built using the C programming language and employs linked lists for dynamic memory allocation, offering a real-life application of data structures in programming. Here's an overview of the project:

## Project Overview

- **Language:** C
- **Data Structure:** Linked List
- **Purpose:** To create an interactive quiz game that enhances understanding of linked lists and provides an engaging user experience.

## Features

1. **Main Menu:** The game features a main menu with four options:
   - **Start Game:** Begin the quiz by entering your username and selecting from 5 different quizzes, each with 10 questions.
   - **Help:** Access instructions and game rules.
   - **Previous Score:** View your previous quiz scores.
   - **Quit Game:** Exit the game.

2. **Interactive Quiz:** Users can choose a quiz, answer questions, and receive immediate feedback on the correctness of their answers. The game also provides the correct reason for each question.

3. **Quiz Results:** At the end of each quiz, the game displays the user's score and provides an option to replay or return to the main menu.

4. **User Records:** The linked list structure allows users to view their previous quiz scores and associated usernames. This feature demonstrates the practical use of linked lists in maintaining data records.

## Learning Experience

Building this quiz game has been a valuable learning experience. It has improved my understanding of C programming, data structures, and dynamic memory allocation. The project's interactive nature and real-time feedback showcase the practical application of these concepts.

## Getting Started

To run the quiz game, compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC) and execute the program .As provide in Quiz Game.c file


## Contributions

Contributions to enhance and improve the quiz game are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests or report issues. Your input can help make this project even better.

## Conclusion

This quiz game offers an engaging way to explore C programming and linked list concepts. Enjoy the quizzes, enhance your knowledge, and check out your previous scores. Thank you for visiting our repository!
